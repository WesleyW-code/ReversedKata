# ReversedKata
 I completed this Kata challenge where i had to reverse a string that is passed through the method. I wanted to add more functionality so i allowed the solution to reverse anything that gets passed through with more than one character. I then added a few more unit tests for the Solution() method to test all possible outcomes such as words, sentences, big numbers getting passed through the method.
 
 ## The description below is the challenge i had to complete:
 
 Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

For example:
'world'  =>  'dlrow'
'word'   =>  'drow'
